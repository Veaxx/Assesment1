        <b>League of Legends (LoL)</b> is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games for Microsoft Windows and macOS. 
        Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, the game follows a freemium model. The game was released on October 27, 2009. 
        An abridged version of the game called League of Legends: Wild Rift for mobile and console, was announced on October 15, 2019.
        In League of Legends, players assume the role of a "champion" with unique abilities, varying around their class, and battle against a team of other player- or 
        computer-controlled champions. In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, the goal is to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, a structure that lies at the heart of their base, 
        protected by defensive structures. The setting of the game, Runeterra, has been expanded through a variety of media, including short stories, comic books, 
        computer-generated cinematics, and spin-off games.
